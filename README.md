Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

- Since this is the first time writing code with Kotlin, I encountered 
some learning curves along the way. Luckily, most of Java can be seen 
within the Kotlin language so I was able to adapt quickly. Another challenge
that I encountered was learning the GitHub software which was never a part of 
my previous knowledge. Overall, it was a simple build and I am excited to see
what comes next for my Kotlin adventure!
